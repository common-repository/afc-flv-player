== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is AFC Plug System required to run the plugin? =
Yes. Since [Advanced Flash Components - AFC](http://www.afcomponents.com/) has many WordPress plugins available, we had to abstract their common functionality, thus the existence of [AFC Plug System](http://www.afcomponents.com/ext/wp/afc-plug-system/).

= Is AFC Plug System available for free? =
Yes. It is absolutely free - download it from [here](http://www.afcomponents.com/ext/wp/afc-plug-system/).

= What is the format of FLV-Player tag? =
AFC FLV-Player uses quicktag  to insert content. WordPress version 2.0 has no support for quicktags when rich-text editor (TinyMCE) is enabled, which has been reported as the bug by plugin users. Right now, even if quicktags are not supported, plugin adds a link below editor text-area, so you can always use it to open tag insertion window.

= I need help, how can I contact developers? =
It's easy - just use our [forum](http://www.afcomponents.com/forum/) on AFC website. There's a dedicated section called "AFC WordPress Plugins", where your feedback and requests are more than welcome.
